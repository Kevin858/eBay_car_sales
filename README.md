# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

Goals: To clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

Dataset: used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka. The original dataset isn't available on Kaggle anymore, but you can find it here.
